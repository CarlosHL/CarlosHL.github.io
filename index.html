        		<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>My name is Carlos Herrero and I am an Spanish double degree student of Computer Science and Business Management from the University 
				Charles III of Madrid.
				<br><br>
				Currently I am studying my senior year in Computer Science in the University of Colorado Boulder, as a part of an exchange program. 
				Here, I am trying to get the best of my international program while getting involved in Boulder's community.

				My main area of interest in Computer Science are Algorithms althought I really enjoy working in front-end since it allows me to start 
				new projects by myself.
