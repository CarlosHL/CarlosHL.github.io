        		<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>My name is Carlos Herrero and I am an Spanish double degree student of Computer Science and Business Management from the University 
				Charles III of Madrid.
				<br><br>
				Currently I am studying my senior year in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, as a part of an exchange program. 
				Here, I am trying to get the best of my international program while getting involved in Boulder's community. With that intention I joined some 
				of the university clubs and associations, as BFIS (Boulder Friends of International Students), Mobile Makers club focused in the development of mobile Apps, and 
				<a href="http://hackcu.org/">HackCU</a>, the organization in charge of Colorado's biggest student hackathon.
				As a member of HackCU, I work with the sponsorship team, helping fundraising money and getting mentors to help the hackers during the hackathon.
				<br><br>
				My main area of interest in Computer Science are Algorithms althought I really enjoy working in front-end since it allows me to start 
				new projects by myself. 
				<br><br>
				Regarding to my Business Management studies, I am interested mainly in Marketing and Markets Research, specially in all concerning the technologic sector.
				<br><br>
				I am currently looking for internship opportunities in Europe or the United States to develop my faculties and exploit my international skills.
